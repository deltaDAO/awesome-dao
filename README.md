A DAO is an organization form expressed as software. Its purpose is to facilitate coordination via collective ownership. It services pre-defined goals, and groups use it to reduce coordination failure. DAOs are an inclusive, transparent and global model for human coordination. Not everything can or should be a DAO.

Pull requests are welcome! In the spirit of decentralized applications however, please ensure your submission is not a paywalled product.

## DAOs Explained by Aragon

"A DAO is a group of people with no central management that coordinate over the internet around a shared set of rules to achieve a common mission.

A more accurate definition would be: A DAO is an internet-native entity with no central management which is regulated by a set of automatically enforceable rules (on a public blockchain), and whose goal is to take on a life of its own and incentivize people to achieve a shared common mission.

DAOs are so good at doing this because they allow for collective ownership over the organization and decision-making that was previously very difficult to maintain at scale.

DAOs consist of people AND software.

- **Incentives**: DAOs incentivize contributors by giving them a say in the future of the organization.
- **Coordination**: DAOs allow people to come together and work on common missions just as easy as joining a chat group.
- **Governance**: DAOs allow people to collaboratively channel common funds towards common missions.
- **Transparency**: DAOs allow anyone with an internet connection to check their members, financials and decisions taken.
- **Scaling**: DAOs scale their workforce dynamically. There are low barriers to entry, allowing new members to join."
